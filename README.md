This project contains a basic encryption/decryption utility written in C called cryptoMagic.
crytoMagic takes two inputs from the command line: a swich to encrypt or decrypt, and a file name.
crytoMagic will encrypt ASCII files given the commands -encrypt [filename], or simply [filename].
it will also decrypt .cpr files given the commands -decrypt [filename].
